# So Long

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview
**So Long** is a small-scale 2D game project that serves as an introduction to computer graphics using the MiniLibX library. This project focuses on creating a basic game environment, handling events, and managing graphics, teaching fundamental concepts like window management, event handling, and texture usage.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements
- Unix/Linux operating system.
- C compiler (CC).
- Basic understanding of the MiniLibX library.

### ðŸ“– Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository URL>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

2. **Compile the project:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Run the program:**
   Provide a map in .ber format as an argument. Example:
   ```bash
   ./so_long map.ber
   ```
   The game will start based on the map provided.

4. **Play the game:**
   Use the W, A, S, and D keys to move the player through the map, collecting items and aiming to reach the exit.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup
To clean up the compiled files:
```bash
make fclean
```

## ðŸ›  Technologies
- **C Language**: Utilized for all game logic and graphics handling.
- **MiniLibX**: The school's graphical library for window and image management.
- **Makefile**: Used for compilation automation and maintaining clean code environment.
- **Norminette**: Ensures code adheres to the 42 School's norm standards.
